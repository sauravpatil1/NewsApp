This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# How to Run Project

> **Note**: Make sure you have android studio(hedgehog) [Hedgehog download](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive). Node version >= 18.

## Step 1: Install Packages

Run following command in root folder of your project.

```bash
# using npm
npm i
```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

You will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

### For Android

1. Open android folder in your android studio.
2. Once build is completed click on run icon to run project.

### For iOS

1. Open project.pbxproj file in xcode.
2. Once build is completed click on run icon to run project.

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
